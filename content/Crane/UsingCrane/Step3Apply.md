The final step of the cluster migration process is to apply all the patches generated by the Transform command to exported resources.

```
crane apply -e export -t transform -o output
```
Apply the patches in the `transform` directory to the resources in the `export` directory and save the modified resource files in the `output` directory.

After applying the patches, the resources located in output directory can either be deployed to the destination cluster using `kubectl apply`, or they can be pushed to a repository and then applied with the help of the GitOps pipeline. An example of the later scenario can be found [here](https://crane-docs.konveyor.io/content/usage/Advance%20Usage/gitops.md).
