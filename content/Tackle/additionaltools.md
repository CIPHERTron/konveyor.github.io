### DIVA
[Tackle DiVA](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-diva) is  a data-centric application analysis tool that imports a set of target application source files and provides database/transaction analysis results.

### Test Generator
[Tackle Test Generator](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-test-generator-cli) is an automatic test-generation and differential-testing tool that currently supports unit-level test generation for Java applications. (Future project plans include adding capabilities for automated generation of end-to-end UI/UX test cases for web applications and test cases for REST APIs.)

### Container Advisor
[Tackle Container Advisor](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-container-advisor) provides containerization advisory information for a large scale application portfolio. It takes a natural language description of applications and recommends whether the applications can be containerized in terms of images from multiple container catalogs (DockerHub, Openshift). (Future project plans  include supporting Operators and recommending disposition that is explainable.)
